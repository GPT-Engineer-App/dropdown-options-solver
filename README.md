# dropdown-options-solver

Can you suggest a way to solve this problem. We have a form, in which there is a dropdown. However, this dropdown should present multiple values: Manager, Center Code, Department and Id. I'm not sure if a dropdown is the best way to present this option table to the user, but we also need to be mindful of the space it requires since it is only one of the components of the form.
